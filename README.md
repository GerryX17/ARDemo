# ARTFG
C# project using unity, APIs, and RA tecnologies
<br> The SDGs (also known as Sustainable Development Goals) are part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development which aims to produce a set of responses to the environmental, political and economic challenges facing our world.
This project aims to raise awareness among participants and readers about one of the 17 SDGs regarding the need to take urgent action to combat climate change and its effects by making use of "new technologies". An augmented reality (AR) application will be designed that through the use of datasets and API calls will allow the user to know at all times the mobility data that are directly related to atmospheric quality and are extracted from a citizen science project (Telraam), being this technology a differentiating factor for the implementation of future projects; this in turn will transmit the data to the user in an interactive way to analyze whether this AR technology has a potential for dissemination for other citizen science projects where it can be applied and can be disseminated to the population who are unaware of the existence of these.
